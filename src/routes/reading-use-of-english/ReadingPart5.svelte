    <ul>
      <li>

        the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        The questions are in order, so the answer to question 2 is always after
        question 1 and the answer to question 3 is always after 2 etc. Sometimes
        it could be question 1 is about paragraph 1, question 2 about paragraph
        2 etc.
      </li>

      </li>

        think about the text written.

    <h1>Example Questions</h1>
    <p>
      You are going to read an extract from a novel in which a young woman
      called Caitlin talks about hr life on an island. For questions 31 - 36,
      choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to
      the text.

      <p>
        We live on the island of Hale. It's about four kilometres long and two
        kilometres wide at its broadest point, and it's joined to the mainland
        by a causeway called the Stand - a narrow road built across the mouth of
        the river which seperates us from the rest of the country. Most of the
        time you wouldn't know we're on an island because the river mouth
        between us and the mainland is just a vast stretch of tall grasses and
        brown mud. But when there's a high tide and the water rises a half a
        metre or so above the road and nothing can pass until the tide goes out
        again a few hours later, then you know it's an island.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>31</strong> In the first paragraph, what is Caitlin's main point
        about the island?
      </p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>It can be dangerous to try to cross from the mainland</li>
        <li>It is much smaller than it looks from the mainland</li>
        <li>It is only completely cut off at certain times</li>
        <li>It can be a difficult place for people to live in</li>

      <h1>Answer</h1>
      <h2>Number (31)</h2>
      <p>
        üõë First, it's important to seperate your opinion from the text. You
        might hate the idea of living on an island, or think what she described
        sounds dangerous, but does it specifically say those things in the text?
      </p>
      <p>
        üëÄ The best thing to do is look for key words that relate to each
        answer. Something like this for this example:
      </p>
      <br />
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><span>a</span> danger</td>
          <td><span>b</span> small size</td>
          <td><span>c</span> cut off at certain times</td>
          <td><span>d</span> difficult to live in</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br />
      <p>
        ü§î It doesn't explicitly talk about any danger or difficulty to live
        there, so that leaves us with two options.
      </p>
      <br />
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="highlight-y"><span>b</span> small size</span></td>
          <td
            ><span class="highlight-b"
              ><span>c</span> cut off at certain times</span
            ></td
          >
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br />
      <p>
        üñåÔ∏è So now let's highlight (or underline) the parts that talk about (B)
        and (C) in the text.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        We live on the island of Hale. <span class="highlight-y"
          >It's about 4 kilometres long and two kilometres wide at its broadest
          point</span
        >, and it's joined to the mainland by a causeway called the Stand - a
        narrow road built across the mouth of the river which separates us from
        the rest of the country.
        <span class="highlight-b"
          >Most of the time you wouldn't know we're on an island because the
          river mouth between us and the mainland is just a vast stretch of tall
          grasses and brown mud. But when there's a high tide and the water
          rises a half a metre or so above the road and nothing can pass until
          the tide goes out again a few hours later, then you know it's an
          island.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Just from the amount of lines highlighted in each colour we get an idea
        what the answer might be, but we should read again to be sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ùå The size of the island is not exactly described as small, this is
        just an opinion that we might have, but the writer <strong
          >hasn't described</strong
        > it as small in anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚úÖ However, the writer does talk about specific times and when things
        can pass, meaning that the answer is (C).
      </p>
      <p>Answer: <span class="highlight2">C</span></p>
