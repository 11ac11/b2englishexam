    <h1>Listening - Part 1</h1>
    <h2>What is listening part 1 like in the First Certificate exam?</h2>
    <p>
      In listening part 1 you get 8 questions that are unrelated. You need to
      choose the correct answer from A, B or C. As with all the parts of the
      listening section, you will get two opportunities to listen.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick tips for listening part 1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All of the answers will have keywords that are mentioned in the audio.
        You're job is to listen carefully and decide which is the correct
        answer. These are called distractors (see below for more information)
      </li>
      <li>
        Revise your knowledge of linkers/connectors. They will use a lot of
        contradicting linkers to show an opposing point of view. If you don't
        understand these, you might miss the proper meaning of the sentence.

    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    <p class="transcript">
      Oh, hi! It's me, John. Sorry to miss you, you must have already left for
      work. Look, I wondered if you wanted to come away for the weekend?
      There'll be about ten of us including someone called Sam Brent who says he
      was at college with you, and he remembers that you were brilliant at rock
      and roll. Er, they've decided it will be on October 9th, Friday night til
      Sunday. Anyway, I'll put the details in the post. I know you're busy at
      the moment, <span>so don't feel you have to come.</span> But, just let me know
      one way or the other when you can. Talk to you soon, bye!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this recording there is no language relating to confirmation, so we
      know immediately it is not (A). <span>I wondered if you wanted toâ€¦</span>
      is a way to invite people, so it looks like it could be (B), but we need to
      listen to it all to make sure. We can confirm it's (B) when the speaker says
      <span>don't feel you have to come</span>, this is non-persuasive language
      and allows the recipient of the message to choose.
