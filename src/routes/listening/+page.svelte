	<h2>What's the Cambridge First Certificate Listening exam like?</h2>

	<p>The test has four sections and takes about 40 minutes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="/">Part 1 - listen to 8 recordings (one question each)</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Part 2 - complete gapped sentences</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Part 3 - 5 speakers and multiple matching</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Part 4 - long recording (7 multiple choice questions)</a></li>
	</ol>
	<p>You get one point for each correct answer.</p>
	<p>You will hear the audio twice. There is likely to be a variety of ages and accents (think Scottish, South African, Australian, Irish etc.) so the best way to prepare is to listen to as many as possible. Try watching films/series and listening to the radio/podcasts in English.
