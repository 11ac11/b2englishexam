    <h1>Speaking - Part 2</h1>
    <h2>What is speaking part 2 like in the B2 First Certificate exam?</h2>

    <p>
      Speaking part 2 is also known as 'long-turn'. You are given two photos and
      a statement to help you compare them. You must compare the photos, not
      just describe them. Then, your partner will be asked a question on the
      same theme as the photos and they will be expected to talk for about 30
      seconds. Your partner will then get a different pair of photos, they will
      speak for a minute and when they finish, you will be asked a question
      about their photos. You should also speak for about 30 seconds.
